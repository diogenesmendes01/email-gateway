# PR16 - TASK 7.2 - Chaos Engineering Framework

## Contexto
- Origem: PR #16
- Descrição: Current chaos engineering implementation consists of basic standalone scripts without orchestration, scheduling, or comprehensive reporting. Need a more mature chaos engineering framework to systematically test system resilience.

## O que precisa ser feito
- [ ] Create chaos orchestration framework (schedule, coordinate multiple scenarios)
- [ ] Build chaos scenarios library (network latency, CPU spike, memory pressure, etc.)
- [ ] Implement chaos scheduling system (automated periodic testing)
- [ ] Add chaos results reporting and analysis
- [ ] Create chaos testing integration in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout (blast radius control)
- [ ] Add automatic rollback on critical failures
- [ ] Document chaos scenarios and expected behaviors
- [ ] Create chaos game days/drills procedures

## Urgência
- **Nível (1–5):** 4

**Justificativa:** Lower priority. Current basic chaos scripts are sufficient for initial testing. A full framework becomes valuable after system matures and we have baseline metrics to validate chaos impact.

## Responsável sugerido
- Platform/SRE team
- DevOps team

## Dependências / Riscos
- **Dependências:**
  - Full observability stack (metrics, logs, tracing)
  - Stable production environment to test against
  - Incident management procedures
  - Monitoring/alerting system

- **Riscos:**
  - Accidental production impact if not properly isolated
  - False positives causing alert fatigue
  - Complex framework could be hard to maintain
  - Need clear governance on who can trigger chaos tests
